[LADY WINDERMERE _bursts into tears and buries her face in her hands_.]

[_Rushing to her_.]  Lady Windermere!

LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Holding out her hands to her_, _helplessly_, _as a
child might do_.]  Take me home.  Take me home.

MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Is about to embrace her_.  _Then restrains herself_.
_There is a look of wonderful joy in her face_.]  Come!  Where is your
cloak?  [_Getting it from sofa_.]  Here.  Put it on.  Come at once!

[_They go to the door_.]

LADY WINDERMERE.  Stop!  Don’t you hear voices?

MRS. ERLYNNE.  No, no!  There was no one!

LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes, there is!  Listen!  Oh! that is my husband’s
voice!  He is coming in!  Save me!  Oh, it’s some plot!  You have sent
for him.

[_Voices outside_.]

MRS. ERLYNNE.  Silence!  I’m here to save you, if I can.  But I fear it
is too late!  There! [_Points to the curtain across the window_.]  The
first chance you have, slip out, if you ever get a chance!

LADY WINDERMERE.  But you?

MRS. ERLYNNE.  Oh! never mind me.  I’ll face them.

[LADY WINDERMERE _hides herself behind the curtain_.]

LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_Outside_.]  Nonsense, dear Windermere, you must not
leave me!

MRS. ERLYNNE.  Lord Augustus!  Then it is I who am lost!  [_Hesitates for
a moment_, then _looks round and sees door R._, _and exits through it_.]

[_Enter_ LORD DARLINGTON, MR. DUMBY, LORD WINDERMERE, LORD AUGUSTUS
LORTON, _and_ MR. CECIL GRAHAM.
